# Ammonium
*"Guaranteed 100% quantum-free!"* - totally not me

Ammonium is a terminal-based universe simulator. It outputs a log in `.csv` format, allowing further plotting and analysis with dedicated software as seen here:

Ammonium works using numerical integration. By using a fixed value for the infinitesimal element of time, it is able to approximate solutions to many problems with near-perfect accuracy.

Quantum mechanics aren't simulated. Updating ammonium to work with quantum mechanics is out of question as of the writing of this document.
